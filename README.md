# Physics Calculator

A Python-based physics calculator designed to compute a wide range of fundamental and advanced physics quantities.

## Purpose

This project is developed to:

* Apply physics formulas through programming
* Strengthen analytical and problem-solving skills
* Build a long-term academic GitHub portfolio
* Support future studies in engineering, physics, and space sciences

## Scope

The calculator is structured to handle many different physical quantities, including but not limited to mechanics-related calculations.
The project is intentionally designed to be expandable, allowing the addition of dozens or even hundreds of physics calculations over time.

## Features

* Command-line based user interaction
* Modular structure using functions
* Unit-aware numerical calculations
* Basic input validation for physical correctness

## Technologies

* Python 3

## Future Development

* Expansion with more physics domains
* Stronger input validation and error handling
* More advanced physics models
* Possible transition to a graphical or web-based interface
