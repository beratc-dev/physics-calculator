# Physics Calculator

A simple physics calculator built with Python to solve fundamental high school-level physics problems using basic formulas.

## Purpose

This project was created to:

* Practice applying physics formulas through programming
* Improve logical and algorithmic thinking
* Build an academic GitHub portfolio for future engineering and science studies

## Features

The calculator currently supports:

* Speed calculation
* Acceleration calculation
* Force calculation (Newton's Second Law)
* Work calculation

All calculations are based on standard SI units.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Clone the repository
3. Run the program:

```
python physics_calculator.py
```

4. Choose a calculation from the menu by entering the corresponding number.

## Topics Covered

* Kinematics (speed and acceleration)
* Newton's Laws
* Work and force relationships
* Unit-based numerical calculations

## Technologies Used

* Python 3

## Future Plans

* Add more physics formulas
* Improve input validation
* Expand into astronomy and space-related calculations
